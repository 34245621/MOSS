            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, I can explain how the values of x and y were obtained. \n\nWe have the two equations: \nx + y = 15  ...(1)\nx - y = 3   ...(2)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use the elimination or substitution method. I will use the elimination method. \n\nAdding equations (1) and (2), we get: \n\n2x = 18 \n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \n\nx = 9 \n\nNow we can substitute the value of x in any of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's substitute x = 9 in equation (1): \n\n9 + y = 15 \n\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get: \n\ny = 6 \n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 9 and y = 6. \n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.<eom>\n"
