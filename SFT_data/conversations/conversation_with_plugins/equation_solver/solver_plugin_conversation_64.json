            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, I'd be happy to explain. We can use the formula: distance = rate x time, where the distance between the two trains is 180 km, and the time elapsed is 1 hour. Let's call the speed of the southern train \"x\". Since the northern train is travelling twice as fast as the southern one, its speed is \"2x\". \n\nSo, using the formula, we can set up an equation: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\n180 km = (x + 2x) x 1 hour \n\nSimplifying the equation gives: \n\n180 km = 3x \n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives: \n\nx = 60 km/h \n\nSo the southern train is travelling at 60 km/h, and the northern train is travelling at twice that speed, or 120 km/h. \n\nI hope that helps clarify the calculation process for you!<eom>\n"
