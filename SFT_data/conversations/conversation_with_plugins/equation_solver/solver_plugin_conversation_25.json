            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: According to the given information, we can set up the equation x/y=2/3. We can simplify this equation by cross-multiplying to get x = (2/3)*y. We also know that the total number of students in the classroom is 25, so we can set up the equation x + y = 25. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get (2/3)*y + y = 25. Solving for y, we get y = 15, which means there are 15 girls in the classroom. To find the number of boys, we can substitute y = 15 into the first equation and get x = (2/3)*15 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 boys in the classroom.<eom>\n"
