            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: To solve the system of equations x + y = 35 and x - y = 9, we can use the Solver function. The Solver function is a tool in Microsoft Excel that can be used to find the optimal solution for a problem by changing certain variables. In this case, we want to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.\n\nFirst, we need to enter the two equations into Excel in separate cells. We can use cell A1 for the equation x + y = 35 and cell A2 for the equation x - y = 9. We can then use the Solver function to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.\n\nTo do this, we need to specify certain parameters for the Solver function. We need to specify the target cell, which is the cell that we want the Solver function to change in order to find the optimal solution. In this case, we want the Solver function to change cells B1 and B2, which represent the values of x and y.\n\nWe also need to specify the constraints for the Solver function. In this case, we want the Solver function to find values of x and y that are greater than or equal to 0.\n\nAfter specifying these parameters, we can run the Solver function and it will find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The values of x and y that the Solver function finds are 22 and 13, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the two numbers that satisfy the conditions of the problem are 22 and 13.<eom>\n"
