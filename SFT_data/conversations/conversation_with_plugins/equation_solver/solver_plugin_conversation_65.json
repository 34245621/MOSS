            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure! Let me explain how I arrived at the answer. \n\nWe are given that the sum of two numbers is 35 and their difference is 11. We can represent these two numbers as x and y. \n\nSo, we can write two equations based on the information given: \n\nx + y = 35  (Equation 1) \nx - y = 11  (Equation 2) \n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously using the solver. The solver calculates the values of x and y based on these two equations. \n\nThe solution is: \nx = 23 \ny = 12 \n\nTherefore, the two numbers are 23 and 12. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<eom>\n"
