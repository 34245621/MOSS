The triple room is 25 yuan per person per day, and the double room is 35 yuan per person per day. If a tourist group of 50 people came to the hotel and rented several rooms, how many rooms need to be rented for each type if the total cost is 1510 yuan per day?<eoh>\n",

Let x and y be the number of triple and double rooms respectively. Then we have the following system of equations:\n```\n25x + 35y = 1510 (total cost per day)\nx + y = 50 (total number of people)\n```\nWe can solve this system of equations to find x and y.<eot>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, let me explain my reasoning. \n\nWe can use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of triple rooms and y be the number of double rooms. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that a triple room costs 25 yuan per person per day and a double room costs 35 yuan per person per day. Therefore, the cost of x triple rooms and y double rooms per day can be expressed as:\n\n25x + 35y = Total cost per day\n\nWe also know that there are a total of 50 people in the tourist group. Therefore, the number of rooms rented must add up to 50, or:\n\nx + y = 50\n\nWe can now solve the system of equations consisting of these two equations to find the values of x and y. \n\nUsing algebra, we can first solve the second equation for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 50 - x\n\nSubstituting this expression for y into the first equation, we get:\n\n25x + 35(50 - x) = 1510\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 24\n\nSubstituting this value of x into the equation y = 50 - x, we get:\n\ny = 26\n\nTherefore, we need to rent 24 triple rooms and 26 double rooms to accommodate the tourist group with a total cost of 1510 yuan per day. \n\nI hope that explanation was helpful! Let me know if you have any more questions.<eom>\n"
