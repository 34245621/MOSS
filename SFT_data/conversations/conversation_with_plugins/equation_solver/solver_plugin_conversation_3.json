            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: To solve the problem, we can use the following system of equations: x + y = 30 (since the sum of two numbers is 30) and x - y = 8 (since their difference is 8). We can use elimination method to solve the system, which involves adding the two equations to eliminate one of the variables. In this case, if we add the two equations, we get 2x = 38, which means x = 19. Substituting x = 19 into one of the equations, say x + y = 30, we get y = 11. Therefore, the two numbers are 19 and 11.<eom>\n"
