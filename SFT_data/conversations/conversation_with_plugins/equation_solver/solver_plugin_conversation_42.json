Then, we have the following two equations:\n\nx + y = 18 (Equation 1)\nx - y = 6 (Equation 2)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use the method of elimination. We add Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate y, and we get:\n\n2x = 24\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 12\n\nSubstituting x = 12 into Equation 1, we get:\n\n12 + y = 18\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 6\n\nTherefore, the two numbers are 12 and 6. I hope that helps!<eom>\n"
