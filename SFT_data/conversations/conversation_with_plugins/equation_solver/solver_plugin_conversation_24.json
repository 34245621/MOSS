            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, let me explain how I arrived at those numbers. We have two equations: x + y = 90 and x - y = 30. We can use the second equation to solve for x in terms of y by adding y to both sides of the equation: \n\nx - y + y = 30 + y \n\nx = 30 + y \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation: \n\n(30 + y) + y = 90 \n\nSimplifying the left side, we get: \n\n2y + 30 = 90 \n\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get: \n\n2y = 60 \n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \n\ny = 30 \n\nNow that we know y is 30, we can substitute this value back into the expression we found for x: \n\nx = 30 + y = 30 + 30 = 60 \n\nSo the two numbers are 60 and 30. I hope this helps!<eom>\n"
