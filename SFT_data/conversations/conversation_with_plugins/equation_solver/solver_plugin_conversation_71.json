            "Human": "<|Human|>: That's correct. Can you explain the steps to solve this problem again, but in simpler terms?<eoh>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, I'd be happy to explain the steps in simpler terms.\n\nFirst, we know that Xiao Li had 24 coins and gave away 5 coins. So, she had 19 coins left.\n\nNext, we know that the ratio of Xiao Li's coins to her friend's coins was 3:2 after she gave away 5 coins. This means that for every 3 coins that Xiao Li had, her friend had 2 coins.\n\nTo find out how many coins Xiao Li's friend originally had, we can use algebra. Let's call the number of coins that her friend originally had \"x\". Then, we can set up an equation based on the ratio we know:\n\nx/2 = 19/3\n\nThis equation says that the number of coins Xiao Li's friend originally had, divided by 2, is equal to the number of coins Xiao Li had left after giving away 5 coins, divided by 3.\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = (19/3) * 2\n\nx = 38/3\n\nSo, Xiao Li's friend originally had 38/3 coins. But we want to know how many coins that is as a whole number. To find out, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number or convert it to a mixed number:\n\n38/3 ≈ 12.67 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\n38/3 = 12 2/3 (as a mixed number)\n\nTherefore, Xiao Li's friend originally had either 13 coins (rounded to the nearest whole number) or 12 and 2/3 coins (as a mixed number).<eom>\n"
