            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem that requires algebra to solve. Let x be the first odd number, then the second, third, and fourth odd numbers are x+2, x+4, and x+6, respectively. The sum of these four numbers is 4x+12, so we can set up the equation 4x+12=116 and solve for x.<eot>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, I can explain the process. Let x be the first odd number, then the second, third, and fourth odd numbers are x+2, x+4, and x+6, respectively. The sum of these four numbers is 4x+12 because there are four terms in the sum and each term is x plus a multiple of 2 (2, 4, or 6). We know that the sum of these four numbers is 116, so we can set up the equation 4x+12=116. To solve for x, we first subtract 12 from both sides to get 4x=104, and then divide both sides by 4 to get x=26. Therefore, the four consecutive odd numbers are 26, 28, 30, and 32. I hope that helps!<eom>\n"
