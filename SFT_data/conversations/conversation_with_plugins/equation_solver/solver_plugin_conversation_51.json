            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem, and I need to use the solver to solve the equation to get the accurate result. Let t be the time B needs to reach D, then A needs 2t and C needs 6t to reach D. We know that the distance each person travels is the same, so we can set up an equation: 2t + 6t + t = 1, which means the sum of their speeds is equal to the distance divided by the time, and the distance is assumed to be 1. Solving this equation, we get t = 1/9.<eot>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure! To calculate the time for B to arrive at D, we can first set up an equation based on the given information. Let t be the time for B to arrive at D. Since A drives for twice as long as B and C drives for three times as long as A, we can represent their driving times in terms of t as follows: A drives for 2t, B drives for t, and C drives for 3(2t) = 6t. \n\nSince they all cover the same distance, we can set the total distance they cover to be equal to the distance from the starting point to D, which we can assume to be 1 unit. \n\nThen, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time to set up an equation based on the information above. The speeds of A, B, and C are 1/(2t), 1/t, and 1/(6t) respectively, since they all cover the same distance. \n\nThus, we have the equation: 1/(2t) + 1/t + 1/(6t) = 1. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: (3/2)t = 1, which gives us t = 2/3.\n\nTherefore, B can arrive at D in t=2/3 hours, which is approximately 40 minutes.<eom>\n"
