            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem. I need to use math to calculate the number of computers in Wuai Primary School. Let's assume the number of computers in Wuai Primary School is x. Then we know that 60 is 1/5 more than x. This means 60 = x + x/5, we can solve this equation to get the result.<eot>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure! Let me explain. \n\nWe know from the problem that Guangming Primary School has 60 computers, which is 1/5 more than Wuai Primary School. Let's assume the number of computers in Wuai Primary School is x. \n\nWe can then set up an equation based on the information given: \n\n60 = x + (1/5)x\n\nTo solve for x, we first need to simplify the right side of the equation by finding a common denominator: \n\n60 = (5x/5) + (x/5)\n\n60 = 6x/5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 gives us: \n\n300 = 6x\n\nDividing both sides by 6 gives us the answer: \n\nx = 50\n\nSo Wuai Primary School has 50 computers. I hope that explanation helps!<eom>\n"
