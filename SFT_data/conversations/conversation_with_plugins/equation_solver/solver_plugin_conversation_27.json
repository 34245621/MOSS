            "Human": "<|Human|>: A number consists of two digits, when multiplied together, the result is equal to 27 times the sum of these two digits. What’s the number?<eoh>\n",
            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem that requires algebraic equations to be solved. Let's assume the tens digit is x and the units digit is y. Then we have the equation 10x+y = 27(x+y). We can simplify this equation to get x = 3y. Substituting this value of x in the first equation we get 10(3y)+y = 27(3y+y). Solving this equation will give us the value of y and the corresponding value of x.<eot>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Let's check whether the equation has multiple solutions or not. We can substitute y with any value that satisfies the equation x = 3y, and we will get a valid solution. For instance, if y = 1, then x = 3, and the number is 31. If y = 2, then x = 6, and the number is 62. Therefore, the equation has multiple solutions, and the number could be either 0, 31, or 62.<eom>\n"
